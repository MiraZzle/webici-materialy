| **Replication**     | N-value, hinted handoff, vector clocks               | Master-slave, asynchronous            | Tunable consistency, quorum-based             | Replica sets with primary node             | Causal consistency (enterprise)             |
| **Sharding**        | Riak ring with consistent hashing                    | Hash slots (16384 slots)              | Consistent hashing, partition keys            | Shard key                                  | Manual (Enterprise supports clustering)     |
| **Consistency**     | BASE (Eventual, quorum-based: \(R+W > N\))           | BASE (Strong eventual)                | BASE (Tunable: `ALL`, `QUORUM`, `ONE`)        | ACID (Multi-document configurable)         | ACID                                        |
| **Writes**          | Vector clocks ensure version tracking                | In-memory, replicated to slaves       | Log-structured, SSTables, upserts             | Journaled writes (WiredTiger engine)       | Transactional for graphs                    |
| **Reads**           | Tunable quorum, often slower due to eventual         | Master-slave consistency              | Tunable quorum, fast with eventual data       | Primary or secondary nodes, configurable   | Optimized for graph traversals              |
| **Deletes**         | Vector clocks track tombstoned versions              | Deletes in-memory, expire via TTL     | Tombstones in SSTables, cleared on compaction | Document deletion and journaling           | Traversal-based deletions                   |
| **Indexing**        | Limited (full-text search via Riak Search)           | Key-based lookups, some range queries | Primary and secondary indexes                 | Compound and text indexes                  | Native graph index                          |
| **Transactions**    | Not supported (quorum emulates consistency)          | Atomic commands, MULTI/EXEC blocks    | Lightweight transactions, conditional updates | Multi-document ACID                        | ACID transactions                           |
| **Fault Tolerance** | High (hinted handoff, gossip protocol)               | Sentinel for failover, cluster redis  | High with quorum and replication factor       | High with replica set failover             | High in enterprise editions                 |
| **Persistence**     | BASE principles (quorum + eventual)                  | Snapshot-based (RDB) or AOF logs      | SSTables and commit logs                      | Journaling and snapshots                   | Journaling                                  |
| **Performance**     | Moderate, optimized for fault tolerance              | Very high for in-memory workloads     | High for write-heavy workloads                | Moderate for balanced workloads            | Slower for very large graphs                |
| **Best Use Cases**  | Fault-tolerant key-value storage, metadata           | Caching, ephemeral session storage    | Write-heavy systems, time-series data         | Semi-structured data, flexible schemas     | Complex relationships and queries           |
| **Weaknesses**      | Conflict resolution, slower writes                   | Memory-limited, single-threaded       | Read overhead, slower compactions             | Single primary bottleneck without sharding | Limited sharding, scaling for huge datasets |
